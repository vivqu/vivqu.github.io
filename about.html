<h1>My name is Vivian 👋</h2>
<br />
<p>By day, I am a software engineer and product thinker. I am currently an engineering manager at <a href="https://www.pathlight.com/" target="_blank">Pathlight</a>. 
    Previously I have worked for <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> and <a href="https://www.firefly.health/" target="_blank">Firefly Health</a>.
</p> 
<p>To date, the hardest project I've worked on is <a href="https://www.pathlight.com/engineering/react-native-at-pathlight" target="_blank">building the Pathlight iOS and Android apps from the ground up</a>. Now I'm focused on scaling our mobile and general engineering practices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I currently live in Oakland with my husband and our border collie, 
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/knucklesthepup/" target="_blank">Knuckles</a>. Previously we lived in Tokyo for a year. 
    Prior to that I studied computer science at Princeton University.</p>
<p>I grew up in the great swamplands of Orlando, Florida. My childhood left me with an enduring love of 
    baby alligators, sweltering summers, and Disney World. You can read my analysis about 
    <a href="/blog/2018/02/12/disney-world-tracking/">Disney's data tracking</a> or 
    <a href="/blog/2018/06/01/disney-tips/">how to optimize your trip to Disney World</a>.</p>
<p class="mb-3">Outside of work, I exist as an hobby probability cloud. Upon observation or interaction, my current state will 
    collapse to one of the following: drinking coffee, writing about software engineering and tech, growing vegetables, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vivqumade/" target="_blank">throwing ceramics</a>, or 
    reading sci-fi and fantasy novels. For best results, use the Large Hadron Collider 
    to take measurements.
