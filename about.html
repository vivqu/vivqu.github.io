<h1>Hi there! I'm Vivian ðŸ‘‹</h2>
<br />
<p>By day, I am an engineer and product thinker. I am currently Head of Engineering at <a href="https://www.pathlight.com/" target="_blank">Pathlight</a>. 
    Previously I have worked for <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> and <a href="https://www.firefly.health/" target="_blank">Firefly Health</a>.
    I got my B.S.E. in computer science at Princeton University.
</p> 
<p></p>
<p>I currently live in Oakland with my husband and our border collie, 
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/knucklesthepup/" target="_blank">Knuckles</a>. Before that, we <a href="https://www.sanfransokyopodcast.com/" target="_blank">lived abroad in Tokyo</a> for a year.</p>
<p>I grew up in the hilarious and strange swamplands of Orlando, Florida. My childhood home left me with an enduring love of 
    baby alligators, sweltering summers, and Disney World. You can read my analysis about 
    <a href="/blog/2018/02/12/disney-world-tracking/">Disney's data tracking</a> or 
    <a href="/blog/2018/06/01/disney-tips/">how to optimize your trip to Disney World</a>.</p>
<p class="mb-3">Outside of work, I exist as an hobby probability cloud. Upon observation or interaction, my current state will 
    collapse to one of the following: drinking coffee, writing about software engineering and tech,
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vivquplants/" target="_blank">growing vegetables</a>,
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vivqumade/" target="_blank">throwing ceramics</a>, or 
    reading sci-fi and fantasy novels. For best results, use the Large Hadron Collider 
    to take measurements.
