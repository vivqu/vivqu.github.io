<p class="subtitle mb-7">Full-time engineer, part-time agent of chaos 👾🎢</p>
<p>Hello there! Welcome to Vivian's little corner of the internet.</p>
<p><b>By day, I am a software engineer and product thinker.</b> I am the mobile engineering lead at <a href="https://www.pathlight.com/" target="_blank">Pathlight</a> (<a href="https://www.pathlight.com/careers" target="_blank">we're hiring!</a>), 
    and have previously worked for
    Pinterest and Firefly Health, building things in iOS and React Native. I also write some mean Python and React, and I can learn whatever else is needed to get the job done. 
</p> 
<p><b>To date, the hardest project I've worked on</b> is building the Pathlight <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pathlight/id1503378050" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pathlight&hl=en_US&gl=US" target="_blank">Android</a> apps from the ground up. Now I'm focused on scaling the mobile apps and growing out the mobile engineering team. Another past project I'm particularly proud of is evaluating React Native for Pinterest's
    tech stack, you can read about it <a

        target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>I currently live in Oakland</b>. I coexist in the universe with my husband and our border collie, 
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/knucklesthepup/" target="_blank">Knuckles</a>. Previously we lived in Tokyo. 
    Prior to that I studied computer science at Princeton University.</p>
<p><b>I grew up in the great swamplands of Orlando, Florida</b>. My childhood also left me with an abiding love of 
    baby alligators, sweltering summers, and Disney World. Read my magna opera<sup>1</sup> about 
    <a href="/blog/2018/02/12/disney-world-tracking/">Disney's data tracking</a> or 
    <a href="/blog/2018/06/01/disney-tips/">how to optimize your trip to Disney World</a>.</p>
<p class="mb-3"><b>When I'm not working, I exist as an interest probability cloud</b>. Upon observation or interaction, my current state will 
    collapse to one of the following: drinking coffee, writing about software engineering and tech, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vivqumade/" target="_blank">throwing ceramics</a>, or 
    reading sci-fi and fantasy novels. For best results, use the Large Hadron Collider 
    to take measurements.

<p class="f6"><sup>1</sup>: Apparently this is the plural of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/magnum_opus" target="_blank">magnum opus</a>.</p>
