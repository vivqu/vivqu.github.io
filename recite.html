        <u>Accurately represents your app's identity:</u> The <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recite/jpngepoglfflfacfcjfodbgnmhejlaoa?hl=en&authuser=0" target="_blank">Recite Extension</a> is
        a simple Chrome extension to display quotations and highlights from a user's Google spreadsheet. This was built by Vivian Qu
        as a small hobby project for herself to use, and the extension is made available to others through the Chrome Web Store.
        The source code is available publically <a href="https://github.com/vivqu/recite_extension" target="_blank">here</a>. It's not
        something created by a company or business for profit or data harvesting.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>What will this app do with user data?</u> The only user data that the extension receives is: name, email, and profile picture. 
        The user information is not stored in the extension but is only displayed for the purposes of authentication. The extension saves
        the authentication token that Google returns in order to request data from the 
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts" target="_blank">Google Sheets API</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>How does this app enhance user functionality?</u> The extension enables users to display the information in a Google spreadsheet
        on a new Chrome tab. It is not possible to access a user's Google spreadsheet content without the OAuth2 authorization process,
        so the enhancement of user functionality is making it possible to display a user's spreadsheet data.

    <p>
        <u>Describe the content, context, or connection to the app:</u> If the user chooses to enter a Google spreadsheet link as a 
        source for quotations or highlights, the extension uses the authentication token to fetch the relevant Google spreadsheet
        information. The extension saves the spreadsheet ID and metadata (such as number of rows, number of columns, page title) 
        in the browser's local storage. This spreadsheet data is used to fetch a row to display on every new tab open. The extension 
        does not persist any rows from the spreadsheet in local storage. If a user removes the spreadsheet link from the source input, 
        the saved data is cleared from local storage.
