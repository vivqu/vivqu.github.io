The turn of the year is the time when book readers everywhere pull out their reading lists. Major news 
publications publish articles rounding up the [best](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/22/books/notable-books.html) 
[books](https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2022) [of](https://time.com/collection/must-read-books-2022/) 
[the](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2022/12/best-books-of-2022) [year](https://www.wired.com/story/best-books-of-2022/). 
People review how many books they finished compared to their new year's resolution goal. Countless blog posts and email 
newsletters are sent out with subjects like "Books I Read in 2022." For a brief few weeks in December and January, 
there is an endless stream of book recommendations that flood email inboxes, landing pages, and social media posts.

*The New Yorker's [Best Books of 2022](https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2022) has at least 200
titles on it. I tried counting all of them but I got tired of counting when I reached 170...*
<br />


I'm an eager participant in the yearly book recommendation ritual. One of my favorite things to do at the end of 
the year is to review everything I've read, making complicated charts on my reading trends and ranking my completed 
books against each other. This data analysis is easy since I'm one of those people that meticulously tracks my 
reading habits. At this point, my book tracker goes back ten years and includes 250 finished books (and counting!). 
From this massive record of book details, I feel confident in recommending the very best titles to anyone who asks.

<br />

On the other hand, I am also conscious of book content overload. My unread book list is infinitely expanding and 
it gets an especially huge chunk of new rows at this time of year like clockwork. I'm an especially fast reader 
but even I still can't keep up with all the books on my backlog. It's hard to prioritize new book titles, even from 
people who I respect and know have reading tastes very compatible with mine. I have an ever-increasing stack of 
purchased books waiting to be read, reminding me of the deep backlog. By the next time I'm at the bookstore or library, 
weeks have passed and I have forgotten which titles have been recommended to me.

A few years ago, I discovered a better way to recommend books with my friends & family: doing an **annual book gifting tradition**. 
This method cuts through the endless books-of-the-year lists and reduces cognitive burden.

It's a very simple process:
1. Choose the best books that you read this year.
2. Write up a short summary of why you picked those books.
3. Send out an email with a signup form for the free book gift. Recipients can choose between a physical book, e-book, or audiobook.
4. Order copies of the book.

I love this because it has positive benefits for everyone involved. Recipients get a free gift--who doesn't love free stuff? 
It's great for me too since books are a pretty affordable way to send friends & family a fun, off-list holiday gift. 
I also find that the people who receive the free copies  are more likely to read them. My gifted book is put on the top of their 
already-purchased book stack, a visible reminder to read it when people reach for their next book, so I have a higher chance of 
receiving a message later with thoughts and reactions! And on top of all that, I can help support my favorite authors and local 
bookstores by ordering the books from [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/info/about-us), which shares the proceeds with an 
independent bookstore of your choice.

Here are my top picks since I started the tradition:
- 2017: [Stories of Your Life and Others](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223380.Stories_of_Your_Life_and_Others), Ted Chiang
- 2018: [The Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power), Naomi Alderman
- 2019: [All Systems Red](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32758901-all-systems-red), Martha Wells (The Murderbot Diaries #1)
- 2020: [Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43126457-trick-mirror), Jia Tolentino
- 2021: [A Deadly Education](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50548197-a-deadly-education), Naomi Novik (The Scholomance, #1)
- 2022: [Blood, Sweat, and Chrome: The Wild & True Story of Mad Max: Fury Road](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57789644-blood-sweat-chrome), Kyle Buchanan

Usually I also try to include a second- and third-place choice from different genres. I read a lot of science-fiction and 
fantasy and, unsurprisingly, I tend to heavily favor books from those genres. Each year, I include approximately 2-3 
runner-up books as well, in case folks have any genre or book type preferences. The majority of books I gift are my
top recommendation, with about a third coming from the runner-up options.

*The statistics for the book types and genres of the top picks. 66.7% of the top picks were fiction, and exactly 50% of 
all the top recommendations were science fiction. Like I said, I have some favorite genres!*
<br />

<br />
![all-books](/assets/img/posts/holiday-books/all-books.png)
*The overall set of books I've recommended (including runner-ups) is more diverse. More than half (57.1%)
are actually non-fiction, and the top categories are dramatic fiction (19%) and non-fiction social-studies (19%) books. 
Next highest genres are science fiction and non-fiction essay collections (14.3%).*
<br />


I'd strongly recommend anyone adopt this tradition as their own. It's been a real joy to me and my loved ones over the years. Even 
while life gets busier and wilder than ever, I will make time to send these book gifts during the holidays. Hopefully, I am 
still doing this many years from now.

My top book this year was [Blood, Sweat & Chrome: The Wild and True Story of Mad Max: Fury Road](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/57789644-blood-sweat-chrome)
by Kyle Buchanan!

<br />
![mad-max](/assets/img/posts/holiday-books/mad-max.jpeg)
<br />

This was truly an epic story, a behind-the-scenes oral history of the making of the latest Mad Max movie. Even if you aren't a fan of 
this movie, it's still well worth a read. 

It took fifteen years to get the film made and the story of how it finally made it to theaters is full of dramatic twists and turns. 
Mad Max was a movie only storyboarded with no written script, filmed in physically harrowing conditions in the Namibian desert, 
with studio executives bewildered by this creative process and actively trying to pull funding away from the movie. People were unsure 
if the director George Miller was a madman or a next-level genius. Miller was 70 years old and had not directed a live-action film for 
17 years by the time Mad Max: Fury Road was finally released.

Here are a few quotes that showcase how wild this book is:

> A film like Fury Road isn‚Äôt just one of a kind‚Äîin this era of increasingly bland superhero movies, it‚Äôs the sort of film that could 
> probably never be made again.

> Parasite director Bong Joon Ho has said that the sheer scale of the movie brings him to tears, while Steven Soderbergh put it more 
> bluntly. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how they‚Äôre not still shooting that film,‚Äù Soderbergh once said, ‚Äúand I don‚Äôt understand how hundreds 
> of people aren‚Äôt dead.‚Äù

I loved Fury Road when it came out but I wasn't a huge fan of the Mad Max franchise itself. After reading this book, I now have mad 
respect for the perseverance and creative intensity of George Miller and his co-creators. I'm planning on doing a movie marathon of 
all the Mad Max movies when Furiosa comes out in 2024!

The runner-up book of the year is [The Well-Gardened Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42201448-the-well-gardened-mind) 
by Sue Stuart-Smith. We built our kitchen garden in June so I've been reading 
a lot of gardening books. This book was a lovely collection of essays about the philosophical and psychological benefits of being in 
nature and working with your hands in the dirt.

<br />
![well-gardened-mind](/assets/img/posts/holiday-books/well-gardened-mind.jpeg)
<br />


Did you know that there's a name for the smell of wet dirt? And how our noses have specifically evolved to detect it? I didn't!

> Part of the pleasure of digging in the garden is the smell of wet earth. The aroma, known as geosmin, is released through the 
> activity of soil bacteria called actinomycetes, and it has a pleasing and soothing effect on most people. The human olfactory 
> center is remarkably sensitive to it, presumably because it helped our prehistoric forebears detect vital sources of life. Some 
> people can even detect it at concentrations as low as five parts per trillion.

Here's another gorgeous quote from the book about the philosophical implications of gardening:

> Shaping a bit of reality is empowering, but crucially in the garden, we are never completely in control. The general rule in life 
> is that we thrive best in situations where we have some control but not complete control. A total lack of control is stressful, 
> and too much control is unstimulating, because life becomes boring and predictable. It is why, paradoxically, experiencing both 
> illusion and disillusion, empowerment and disempowerment, doesn't make us give up‚Äîit only spurs us on.

I also read a lot of fiction by female Asian-American writers this year, including:
- [Free Food for Millionaires](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40727626-free-food-for-millionaires) by Min Jin Lee
- [Disorientation](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58350424-disorientation) by Elaine Hsieh Chou
- [Counterfeit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59314709-counterfeit) by Kirstin Chen
- [Chemistry](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31684925-chemistry) by Weike Wang

They were all enjoyable reads and it was interesting to see similar themes of identity, estrangement, and cultural assimilation brought 
out by reading them all so close together. If I had to pick only one, I would recommend Counterfeit as my favorite of all of these. 

<br />
![counterfeit](/assets/img/posts/holiday-books/counterfeit.jpeg)
<br />

Here's a [great interview](https://doree.substack.com/p/i-knew-from-the-start-this-was-a) with Kirstin Chen about the book where she reveals that the counterfeit handbag storyline was based on a 
real-life scammer:

> Well, so the scheme in the book is pretty much exactly that scheme and so oftentimes, people will say, how did you come up with such 
> an ingenious scheme? And I will say, I didn't. And they'll say, did you ever consider changing it? And I didn't because it was so 
> perfect, it was just so seemingly foolproof. So, that scheme I could not have invented one better. It was so simple and so 
> understandable and yet so bold and just ticked all the boxes that I was like, there was no way I can mess with this. So, that was 
> the first thing that grabbed me the most. But then the other thing that I thought was fascinating was that the real-life con artist was 
> an Asian preschool teacher. You cannot make that up.
