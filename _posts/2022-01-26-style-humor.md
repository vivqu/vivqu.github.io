My college freshman introductory writing class was the last time I formally studied
the elements of good writing. I don't remember much about the course, except that it
was required and boring. We wrote a lot of essays, got some instructor feedback,
and maybe read a "classic" informational text on writing like [_Elements of Style_](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-William-Strunk-Jr/dp/194564401X).
The class taught to the lowest common denominator, in the same style as my high school English courses, 
where we would be assigned tedious five-paragraph essays to mechanically produce. Since I've always been an avid reader and halfway decent
at writing intuitively, I didn't learn anything new that I hadn't subconsciously absorbed 
from elsewhere. My papers got good scores and I moved on, devoting my precious mental energy to 
struggling through my engineering courses.

After college, I continued my writing education the way I found most helpful: by reading
excellent writing. Any books on writing that I did read were more about the [process of writing](https://www.amazon.com/Bird-Some-Instructions-Writing-Life/dp/0385480016) rather than the content and structure of the writing itself. I trusted my
instinct and accumulated reading knowledge to shape my writing. As 
Stephen King wrote in his memoir [_On Writing_](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Memoir-Craft-Stephen-King/dp/1982159375/ref=asc_df_1982159375/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=459730632142&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15502447996201435330&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9032067&hvtargid=pla-922297684233&psc=1),

> Constant reading will pull you into a place (a mind-set, if you like the phrase) where you can write eagerly and without self-consciousness. It also offers you a constantly growing knowledge of what has been done and what hasn't, what is trite and what is fresh, what works and what just lies there dying (or dead) on the page. The more you read, the less apt you are to make a fool of yourself with your pen or word processor. ... [R]ead a lot, write a lot" is the great commandment.

So I was skeptical when my husband told me Joseph Williams' [_Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace_](https://www.amazon.com/Style-Lessons-Clarity-Grace-12th/dp/0134080416/ref=sr_1_1?crid=39VHOP1R0BJQC&keywords=style+joseph+williams&qid=1643043689&s=books&sprefix=style+joseph+williams%2Cstripbooks%2C167&sr=1-1) was an excellent book. And not only that, it was the "best book on writing he's ever read." 

Was the best book on writing really an English textbook written by a college professor? This seemed unlikely given my experience with mediocre college writing courses. Still, I decided to give it a chance. 

After reading the book cover to cover, including the appendix on punctuation, I can confirm that
it is an extremely useful book. It's _not_ a dry sermon on grammar rules and the evils of passive voice. Williams provides practical guidelines
for structuring writing (and when passive voice is not only appropriate, but important). He gives powerful techniques for viewing your own writing through 
the lens of the reader. He even provides a thoughtful framework for analyzing the more intangible aspects of good writing style like elegance and 
gracefulness. I read one chapter a day for two weeks and I gained more practical takeaways in those two weeks than all my
high school and college English classes combined.

As for what the specific takeaways from the book are, I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader. I haven't even fully absorbed all of the learnings
myself. You can see my heavily-bookmarked copy as evidence of how many times I will reference this book in the future:

<br />
![style_book](/assets/img/posts/style-humor/style-book.png)
*Lots of really useful learnings in every chapter of this book.*
<br />

I strongly recommend everyone read this book. Williams himself practices what he preaches: his writing is cogent, clear, and engaging.
And this book is not only those who want to improve their writing! The subject of what makes good writing, and how and why it is perceived
as good, is interesting on an abstract level. Just as general physics and history books can help you make sense of your experience of the universe
and human civilization, Williams' book helps you understand your experience as a reader of good (and bad) writing.

Most of all, you should read this book because it's very funny. I didn't think that a book with so many sentence diagrams, just pages and pages of analyzing fundamental grammatical and stylistic sentence parts, would have such incredible dry humor. My favorite parts of the book are the sections where Williams actually writes less--he revises torturous and esoteric prose into short, blindingly clear sentences with devastating results. 

For example, here is his conclusion after he revises a 96-word excerpt down to just 30 words:

> My versions lose the nuances of Parson's style, but his excruciating density numbs all but his most masochistically dedicated readers. Most readers would accept the tradeoff. (p. 72)

Here is another funny passage where Williams destroys grammar snobbery with almost surgical precision:

> "Next is a typical situation **which** a practiced writer corrects "for style" virtually by reflect action." --Jacques Barzun, _Simple and Direct_
>
> Yet just a few sentences before, Barzun himself (one of our most eminent intellectual historians and critics of style) had asserted, "Us[e] _that_ with defining [i.e. restrictive] clauses except when stylistic reasons interpose."
>
> (In the sentence quoted above, no such reasons interpose.) 
> 
> A rule has no force when someone as eminent as Barzun asserts it on one page, then violates it on the next, and his "error" is never caught, not by his editors, not by his proofreaders, not even by Barzun himself. (p.19)

So if nothing else, pick up this book for some satisfying takedowns of old dead writing elitists.

As I progressed through the book at the rate of one chapter a day, I noticed an interesting side effect of reading this way. I could easily tell
which chapters were longer than others based on the relative time it took to read. 

If we assume that Williams did his best to explain everything in the book as clearly and concisely as possible, then it must be the case that certain aspects
of writing take much longer to explain than others. This certainly makes intuitive sense, since discussing how elegant or graceful a sentence is feels far more tricky than deciding if the sentence is clear or muddled to the reader.
We can therefore try to quantify each chapter by the time taken to explain to readers (number of pages) as the measure of "difficulty" for
that writing topic. Comparing the chapters against each other should then theoretically show their relative difficulty.

Williams divides his book into three major sections: "Clarity", "Grace", and "Clarity of Form." Within each, he breaks the larger themes
down into individual chapters. If we count up the number of pages:

{:.post-table}
| Section | Chapter | Page count |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Clarity | Actions  | 20 |
|  | Characters      | 21 |
|  | Cohesion and Coherence | 17 |
|  | Emphasis      | 18 |
| Grace | Concision  | 20 |
|  | Shape | 29 |
|  | Elegance | 23 |
| Clarity of Form | Motivating Coherence  | 13 |
|  | Global Coherence | 13 |

On average, chapters in the "Clarity" section took 19 pages to explain while chapters in "Grace" took 24 pages to explain. We can perhaps infer
that teaching and improving the gracefulness of writing is at least 26% harder. 

Comparing pages is obviously a dramatic oversimplification of the difficulty for these aspects of writing. We should also take into account the
meta-structure of the book itself, where chapters and subjects that come later are meant to build on top of a foundation of knowledge that
Williams has previously established. Therefore we cannot say that "Grace" is _only_ 26% harder than "Clarity" (or that "Clarity of Form" is 50%
easier than both) because improvements to grace and clarity of form in writing demand a mastery of the preceding sections.

Another complicating factor is that the book covers increasingly ambiguous and difficult to explain topics. In "Clarity", Williams 
is able to provide general principles to follow. There are exceptions and ambiguities of course, but by and large, writers can diligently 
follow these rules. 

Once we get to the subject of "Grace", Williams can only give options for revision rather than specific principles to 
follow. In lesson 8 ("Shape"), after providing techniques for achieving "coordination"--the balance of clauses and phrases within sentences--he ends the 
subject by pointing out the difficult of detecting good coordination,

> Unfortunately, I can't tell you how to recognize when elements are not coordinate in thought.

By the time we reach lesson 9, the unexplainability of the new concepts are front and center. Williams starts the introduction for "Elegance" with,

> Anyone who can write clearly, concisely, and coherently should rejoice to achieve so much. But while most of us prefer bald clarity to the density of institutional prose, others feel that relentless simplicty can be dry, even arid. It has the spartan virtue of unsalted meat and potatoes, but such are is rarely memorable. A flash of elegance can not only fix a though in our minds, but give us a flicker of pleasure every time we recall it.
> 
> Unfortunately, I can't tell you how to do that. [...] Nevertheless, there are a few devices that can shape a thought in ways that are both elegant and clear.

And finally in lesson 11, "Global Coherence", we can't even learn specific devices anymore to achieve global relevance across our writing,

> [...] When readers can't see the relevance of sentences to a point, they are likely to judge what they read incoherent.
> 
> I am sorry to say that I can't give you a simple rule of relevance, because it's so abstract a quality. I can only list its most important kinds.

So rather being able to apply a simple difficulty multiplier, it's probably more like an exponential difficulty curve going from achieving clarity,
to achieving gracefulness, and to finally achieving a clarity of form in our writing. And that's not to say sentence-level clarity in writing is easy. 
I can see it taking me years to master what Williams laid out as good principles for clarity within the book. From there, my subjective analysis 
of the book's content indicate that grace is at least 3x harder than clarity. Clarity of form is likely 10x or more effort and study than gracefulness.

It's hard to definitively say how long or difficult improving certain aspects of your writing is. Even Williams, who wrote this excellent book to help us 
get better faster, has labored for years to improve his writing. I read the ninth edition of _Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace_, which includes this
humbling preface,

> After twenty-five years of revising this book, you'd think by this time I'd have it right, but there always seem to be sentences that make me slap my forehead, wondering how I could have written them.

It will be a lifelong journey to mastering writing, if that's even possible, so it helps to have a lot of good reference material and humor to help us along the way.
