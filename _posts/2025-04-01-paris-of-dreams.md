"Akogare no Paris" is a Japanese phrase which means "the Paris of our dreams." It refers a version of Paris that is  constructed by elaborate fantasy in our own minds. The media and art that we consume strongly influence our imagination of these places. And these romantic versions can exist in our minds forever—unless they one day come into contact with reality.

The imagined depiction of real-world places in movies and shows can be more compelling than real places. Studio Ghibli is famous for creating a beautiful, dream-like vision of Europe in their extensive filmography, such as _Kiki's Delivery Service_ and _Howl's Moving Castle_. These stories are set in quaint 19th-century towns, filled with painstakingly period-accurate architectural details, while telling fantasy narratives filled with steampunk and magical realism elements. As Dani Cavallaro writes in [_The Anime Art of Hayao Miyazaki_](https://amzn.to/4iPwWHT), the masterful filmmaker has created:

> an elaborately fantasized version of Europe as seen "through Eastern eyes." Indeed, the setting is essentially a fantastic synthesis of diverse European locations, simultaneously redolent of the Italian Alps, of Bavarian castles, of Mont-Saint-Michel and of the Cote d'Azur.

<br />

 Miyazaki's version of Europe is a blend of fantasy and reality, intended to evoke both nostalgia and a hopeful vision of the future. Somehow he has managed to balance both feelings and merge them seamlessly in a cityscape that is both classical and futuristic. As Studio Ghibli founder and producer Toshio Suzuki shares about the creation of _Howl's Moving Castle_:
 
> ... the film concurrently visualizes actual elements of 19th-century culture and society, and images of later epochs as envisioned at the time. Suzuki has discussed at some length this aspect of Miyazaki's latest movie and noted that when Miyazaki was "wondering what period the movie should be set in," he came up with the 19th-century for the principal reason that he was fascinated with the many artists who "drew 'illusion art' in Europe back then.... They drew many pictures imagining what the 20th-century would be like. They were illusions and were never realized after all." The spellbinding power of such images, for Miyazaki, resides in their ability to conjure up "a world in which science exists as well as magic, since they are illusion," and in which conventional boundaries separating the rational from the irrational, the measurable from the incommensurable, and fact from fantasy are, consequently, radically undermined.


But what happens when these beautiful, imagined visions of Europe come into contact with the true reality of the places themselves?

Japanese tourists who visit Paris, upon encountering a reality so far from the city of their dreams, can often feel a disappointment so strong that they can experience states of anxiety, delusion, and derealization. This intense form of culture shock is known as [Paris syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome), coined in the 1980s by Japanese psychiatrist Hiroaki Ota.

Though the term refers to the experience of Eastern tourists who visit Paris, this sharp divide between the imagined place and it's reality also applies to Western travelers visiting Japan. With the rise of anime's popularity, international audiences have grown up on stories set in Tokyo and Japanese towns. The artistic depictions of the buildings, streets, and trains are so realistic, often replicating specific real-world locations, that it gives viewers the sensation that they are present. We feel like we've been to these imaginary places already and know them deeply.

Fans of Japanese media who have constructed a mental picture of Japan are inexorably driven to visit in person, to take a pilgrimage to the country itself. As Clothilde Sabre writes in [_French Anime and Manga Fans in Japan_](https://contents-tourism.press/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IJCT-Vol.-1.1-Sabre-2016.pdf): 

> When dreaming about Japan and going to visit Japan, fans are guided by the specific imaginary composed of elements selected from pop culture, a process that characterises the appropriation of the contents by fans. This imaginary is then shaped by the exotic filter which determines their perception of the country. This exotic aspect plays a large part in the pleasure the fantasyscape can bring. Since fans are constantly immersed in the universe of Japanese pop culture they feel a strong intimacy and familiarity with Japanese culture, even if they have never visited the country. They have a strong longing for Japan, a kind of nostalgic and projective desire that comes from their personal fantasy of Japan and that pushes them to travel and experience the ‘real’ country.

> The idea of a ‘specific nostalgic picture’ of Japan, shared by French tourists who were familiar with Japanese animation on television and inspired by these memories of childhood, is a good example of these specificities. All the French fans share this idea of a golden age of Japanese animation in France and tend to look for the references associated with this period once in Japan.

And just like Paris syndrome, the gap between expectations and reality can be enormous. It can feel underwhelming when, faced with the actual lived experience of the sights and sounds of Japan, it doesn't live up to the ideal created by meticulously crafted storytelling. The flawed truth of Tokyo as a city where normal humans live and work can't compare to the nostalgic perfection in our minds.

To me, Makoto Shinkai is the master of creating this deep nostalgia for every day Japan in the hearts of foreign audiences, just as Miyazaki has built up the dream of a new age [Ruritania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruritania) in Europe for Asian viewers. As this stunning visual compilation shows, the color and detail of Shinkai's animation so closely mirrors the real world:

<br />

And even though it visually mimics locations in the real world, Shinkai's movies—the most well-known being [Your Name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayi6VfCKBcA), [Weathering with You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6iK6DjV_iE), and [Suzume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfKNOUUtyCA)—tell stories filled to the brim with magic realism. The characters struggle against titanic forces of destruction using time travel, magical powers, and transfiguration. His stories explore grand themes of love and destiny in front of a backdrop of a mundane, slice of life existence.

The risk of visiting these places is that the experience of seeing them in real life will not have the same emotional resonance as the same scene filtered through the lens of Shinkai and Miyazaki.

*Side-by-side comparison of the iconic staircase from the Your Name movie and real life<br/>(source: [r/interestingasfuck](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/v0pv3z/the_iconic_staircase_in_movie_your_name_and_the/))*
<br />


But it is Shinkai's _Your Name_ that gives us a blueprint for how we can transcend this crushing disappointment with reality. The movie centers on a teenage boy and girl, Taki and Mitsuha, who each have idealized and stereotyped views of the other's life. It starts as a classic story of [city mouse and country mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Town_Mouse_and_the_Country_Mouse), with all the hijinks that ensue for these two adapting to different lifestyles. Over time, their conflict and viewpoints grow beyond superficial perceptions. Deep empathy and emotional connection create a beautiful relationship that not only helps save a town, but also conquers time and space itself.

So rather than just stopping at the nadir of our sadness when confronted with the rudeness of reality, we should seek to understand the place even more. The parts of Paris and Tokyo that don't match our expectations aren't inherently bad. Neither are they fixed. Once we start seeing the world for what it actually is, we can more deeply engage with the places themselves. Only then can we start falling in love with the actual city, not just the idea of the city, and become a participant in the real world rather than a passive consumer of a fantasy one.
