        This policy describes the information that the Recite Chrome extension uses and how that information is handled.
        The extension's use of information from the API adheres to the 
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes" target="_blank">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>,
        including the Limited Use agreement.

                <u>Who is requesting Google user data?</u> 
                The <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recite/jpngepoglfflfacfcjfodbgnmhejlaoa?hl=en&authuser=0" target="_blank">Recite Chrome extension</a>
                is a free Chrome extension that uses a user's Google spreadsheet to display quotes and highlights.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>What data are you requesting?</u> The extension uses the OAuth2 authentication process to request
                name, email, profile picture, and an authentication token to access the content within a Google spreadsheet, using 
                read-only Google Sheets access.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Why are you requesting Google user data?</u> The extension enables users to display the information in a Google 
                spreadsheet on a new Chrome tab. It is not possible to access a user's Google spreadsheet content without the OAuth2
                authorization process, so the enhancement of user functionality is making it possible to display a user's spreadsheet data.

    <h1>Sensitive API Scopes</h1>

    </ul>
    <p>
        The extension's use of information received from the API adheres to the 
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes" target="_blank">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>,
