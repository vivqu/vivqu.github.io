<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="subtitle f6 mt-2 mb-5">
    This page was last updated on Feb 12, 2023.
</p>
<p>This policy describes the information that I, Vivian Qu, may receive from Recite chrome extension users and how that information is handled.</p>
<p>What I want, what’s most important to me, is:</p>
<div class="ml-6">
    <ul>
        <li>To enable usage of Google spreadsheets in order to display quotes.</li>
        <li>To be able to identify and fix crashes & bugs in the extension.</li>
        <li>To log traffic to this website and view in aggregate.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>In other words, I don’t want any private information — except for what is necessary information to be able to identify and fix crashes & bugs, and things like how many times the extension has been downloaded.</p>
<p>Much of this policy was proudly copied directly from the <a href="https://superhighway.info/privacy.html" target="_blank">Information Superhighway</a> policy. I appreciated the conciseness and readability of IS's policy and thought it worthy of stealing.</p>

<h2>Google OAuth2 Access</h2>
<p>Authenticating with your Google account is only required for the purposes of determining permissions and access to a Google spreadsheet.
    No data is collected on your email or spreadsheet information. Google does collect anonymized information on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/monitoring" target="_blank">traffic, errors, and media latency</a> for APIs.
</p>

<h2>Crash Logs</h2>
<p>Currently, there is no specific libraries or APIs that are being used to log crashes. This is something that I may add in the future and the
    data will only be collected to faciliate fixing bugs and issues.
</p>

<h2>Website Logging and Trackers</h2>
<p>Visits to the website are logged via anonymized Google Analytics. I am only interested in basic information like number of visitors to a particular blog post. You can read more about the website's general privacy policy <a href="/privacy">here</a>.</p>
