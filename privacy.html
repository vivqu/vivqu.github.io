<div class="mt-2">
    <p>By contacting me through email or a private message on any social media, you agree to engage in polite and
        respectful dialogue. I will not share your name or contact information without your prior consent.
    </p>
    <p>However if you act like a jerk and do not follow the guidelines above, I reserve the right to call you out
        and/or block you in order to keep this a pleasant little corner of the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        I take your privacy seriously. In order to track basic web traffic analytics, I use a cookieless method
        for Google Analytics on this website. It uses a fingerprinting technique that anonymously identifies
        web browsers using the region or general location of a computer or device accessing the internet, browser
        type, operating system, and other statistical information. No IP addresses are stored in Google Analytics.
        You can read more in the software license I've included at the bottom of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        As of May 2023, I also added Google Analytics 4 tracking to the website since the old analytics
        libraries are deprecated as of July 1, 2023. IP masking is not necessary for GA4, according
        to their <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en" target="_blank">docs</a>,
        since IP addresses are not logged or stored.
    </p>
    <p>This website is built using Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages.</p>
    <p>Please <a href="mailto:hello@vivqu.com" target="_blank">email me</a> if you have any questions.</p>
